## 🤖 AI-Accelerated Development Workflow
This project was a deliberate exercise in rapid, modern web development, leveraging Large Language Models to accelerate the process from concept to deployment.

My role was that of an architect and prompt engineer. I provided Google's AI Studio (using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model) with my resume, cover letter, and a clear sitemap. The model generated the foundational HTML structure and Vanilla JavaScript for the single-page functionality.

An interesting outcome of this process was the model's insistence on using **Tailwind CSS** for styling directly in the HTML, rather than a separate stylesheet. Recognizing the efficiency of this utility-first framework for a single-page app, I accepted this recommendation and focused my manual efforts on refining the responsive design and integrating my content.

This AI-assisted approach enabled a complete build—from initial prompt to content writing, integration, and deployment—in just **two days**.
